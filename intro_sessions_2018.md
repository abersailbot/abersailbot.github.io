# Introduction to AberSailbot 2018

These sessions are for new members to get some basic knowledge of the key technologies behind AberSailbot. 
We'll try and record or make the material from each session available, but most of them are quite hands on and work best if you are there!
If you are already confident about some of these subjects then still come along and help others.
