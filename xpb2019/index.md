# eXperimental Polystyrene Boats Competiton 2019

## Aims

This competition aims to introduce new AberSailbot members to robotic sailing and the systems used in AberSailbot's other boats.

* Compass
* Captain Morgan board (with GPS, Arduino and LEDs)
* Rudder Servo
* Sail motor
* Wire
* 2x batteries
